### Stuff to Note before trying to send emails

Make sure that you've enabled "Allow less secure apps" on your Gmail settings page to avoid any issues.

The only dependency is `nodemailer` which can be installed by
`npm install nodemailer`

Make sure to input your email and password in the file and do not track the files under git for obvious reasons
