                {
                    question: "If Musicoin isn't based on traditional currency, how do listeners obtain coins?",
                    answer: (`Early adopters will get coins from an ICO (initial coin offering), mining, or
                    peer-to-peer exchange. Later adopters will be able to exchange coins from fiat currency via
                    exchanges. Eventually, it could be as easy as buying an digital gift card from
                    convenient store.`)
                },
                {
                    question: "Who sets the price per play--the musician or the listener?",
                    answer: (`Our goal is to allow musicians themselves to control everything.
                    They can follow the template to set a standard price (which is one coin per play), or
                    they can set a higher or lower prices based on their personal will. Additionally,
                    musicians can customize how how each payment is distributed.`)
                },
                {
                    question: "What incentive is there for fans to pay for music?",
                    answer: (`We believe that users, in general, would be happy to support
                    their favorite musicians and that piracy is driven by two factors:
                    (1) convenience and (2) a disconnect between the listener and the artist.
                    By building a simple, low-cost system that provides a direct connection
                    between listeners and artists, we believe there will be little incentive to
                    obtain music illegally.`)
                },
                {
                    id: "GetAnInvite",
                    question: "How can I obtain an invite?",
                    answer: (`We want to make sure every musician and listener has a good experience
                    using musicoin, so weâ€™re slowly ramping up the number of users.  If you are a musician
                    or just interested in beta-testing, send an email to musicoin@musicoin.org.`)
                },
                {
                    id: "WhatAreShares",
                    question: "What are shares?  Can I use percentages instead?",
                    answer: (`Shares should be expressed in whole numbers.  If your shares add up to 100, they are the
                    same as percentages.  However, sometimes it's easier to just express things in shares.  For instance,
                    if there are three band members, and all of them should get an equal amount, instead of writing 33.333%
                    for each, just give each member 1 share.  If you would rather express as percentages, you can.
                    In fact, in the case above you can give everyone 33 shares.  It's ok that is only adds up to 99, since everyone will
                    get 33 out if 99 shares (exactly 1/3rd).  Finally, the license Preview page will show the computed
                    percentage.`)
                },
                {
                    id: "WhatIsARecipient",
                    question: "What should I enter in the 'recipient' field when creating a license?",
                    answer: (`A recipient needs to be an address on the musicoin network.  You can find your address
                    on the 'my profile' page by clicking the 'show options' link in the 'my wallet' section.  For
                    convenience, you can enter an email address of a registered user.  If that user has created a profile,
                    you will see their address in the preview page along with the email address you entered.  You can
                    also enter the address of another license.  For example, if you have an agreement with another artist
                    to pay them 10% of each play for sampling from their song, you can enter their song's license address
                    in the recipient field.  Then, each time your song is played, it will send 10% to their license, and
                    then their license will distribute the payment as it normally would for a play.`)
