        <section>
          <p>Musicoin is designed to support the creation, publication, and consumption of music as a cycle. The system
            uses a special algorithm to generate a currency called Musicoin (MC), as well as another algorithm to
            support automated contracts ("smart contracts") which enable creators and consumers to exchange value in a
            frictionless environment. With a unique currency and a solid contract system, large scale transactions
            around music becomes possible.</p>

          <h3>Sharism</h3>
          Sharism is the fundamental philosophy underlying the Musicoin system, and it is from this perspective that
          people are enabled to share their creations online and be paid every time their creation is played (or read,
          enjoyed, etc. depending on the context). So for a musician's work that is released to a system, the system
          traces the usage and returns the prescribed value directly to them in a way that is in line with the principle
          of equal energy exchange.

          <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="eximages/sharism.png" alt=""/></a>

          <h3>The Currency</h3>

          <p>The Founders of Musicoin designed a global currency (MC) to support the requirements of the Musicoin
            system. The currency is not issued by a single entity, but by a network of computers through a process known
            as ‘mining’. This system, which has been proven by other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash
            and others, involves many computers around the globe running a complex computer algorithm, with the entire
            network collaborating to generate a currency which can’t be counterfeited, can’t be “double spent”, and
            can’t be manipulated or otherwise damaged through negligence or malicious intent. As a fully visible,
            transparent and decentralized system, the traditional default of utilizing a centralized controlling
            authority (central bank etc.) is made obsolete, and a thing of the past. </p>

          <h3>Smart Contracts</h3>
          <p>
            With the trust-able and immutable MC currency, smart contacts can then be created to run automatically to
            ensure that payments are made correctly, directly and immediately, and also that the correct content is
            shared to the requesting party. A series of contract templates have been designed that can be used by
            creators for different types of usage and consumption. The first, and perhaps most important contract is the
            Pay-Per-Play (PPP) contract. PPP automates the unit consumption of music (i.e. streaming of one song) so
            that once the listener clicks ‘play’, there is an immediate transaction which pays the creator directly as
            specified within the contract. Again, each and every transaction is recorded and made visible on the
            network, eliminating any possibility of tampering or removal.
            <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="eximages/distribution.png" alt=""/></a>
          </p>

            <p>Other smart contract
            templates will be added to the system in future, enabling creators to control and expand their capacity to
            license works for a wider range of uses, and also to provide contracts with greater flexibility and
            additional features.
            </p>


          <h3>Musiconomy</h3>

          <p>The mechanisms described above are designed to set a foundation that empowers musicians to release their
            works to the system, while enabling listeners to enjoy them in a seamless, frictionless flow. As this
            process expands and repeats itself, it is anticipated that it will eventually become a large scale
            phenomenon requiring no further intervention. The more releases, the more listeners; the more listening, the
            more income to musicians; the more income, the more creations. It is precisely the positive feedback loop
            described by the Sharism philosophy. It is even conceivable that Musicoin cryptocurrency could eventually be
            redeemable for other types of music-related goods and services i.e. concert tickets, merchandise, tour
            packages, or potentially even redeemed for general consumer goods, travel services etc.</p>

          <h3>Future potential</h3>
          <p>
            The Musicoin team envisions a long and expansive future for the Musicoin system as a whole. With music being
            indispensable to life in human society, the completeness of the data recorded on the Musicoin system may
            eventually serve as a useful source of reference to pre-select songs for playlists using AI. Imagine a
            machine that plays what it ‘knows’ you will want to hear when you want to here it. That reality is just
            around the corner, and Musicoin comes designed to integrate seamlessly with such a machine.</p>

            <p>PPP is the basic smart contract of the Musicoin system that enables musicians to release their works and

            <p>Apart from Pay-Per-Play, there are other contracts in development, including playlist, sharing and
              additional licence contracts. These contracts are intended to incentivize listeners and other musicians to
              share and recycle music in different formats and venues according to the permissions and the will of the
              creator(s).</p>
